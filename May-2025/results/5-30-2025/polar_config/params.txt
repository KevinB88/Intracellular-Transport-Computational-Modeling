Parameters for mass analysis under the polar configuration (polar_config)

Domain: 36x36
v = -10
w = 10^3
Microtubule configuration: [0, 9, 18, 27]

# simulation time
T = 1.0

# Note, MFPT was computed with respect to the time used to collect the resulting mass analysis results
# In this case, it was computed for T = 1.0
Resulting MFPT: 0.2965961272931763
