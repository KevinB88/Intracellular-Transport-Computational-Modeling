Parameters for mass analysis under the rectangular configuration (rect_config)

Domain: 36x36
v = -10
w = 10^3
Microtubule configuration: [0, 9, 18, 27]

# simulation time
T = 1.0

d_tube = 0.02181661564992912
# this corresponds to the maximum d_tube value before overlap takes place with respect to the provided microtubule configuration

# Note, MFPT was computed with respect to the time used to collect the resulting mass analysis results
# In this case, it was computed for T = 1.0
Resulting MFPT: 0.30057385110704515
