Approach #1:

Looked at 4 different stages of the mass retention at levels of approximately 75%, 50%, 25% and near 1% of the mass remaining. Each row in the csv refers to the following criteria:

        row 1 : 0.675 < mass_retained < 0.68
        row 2 : 0.45 < mass_retained < 0.46
        row 3 : 0.225 < mass_retained < 0.26
        row 4 : 0.015 < mass_retained < 0.02

    Sub-folder structure:

    0.25    : Refers to the 1/4 th ring of the domain
    0.5     : 1/2 th ring
    0.75    : 3/4 th ring


Approach #2:

Looking at "early" and "late" times of mass retention within the domain, which is gauged by the global peak time (of rate of mass loss) computed by the radial current function j(t)

   First row in the csv refers to "early" time, and the second is "late" time.

   Number of time-steps it took in order to reach the global max at velocity peak values (from velocity dependence computations)

     V      Time steps    Simulation Time

    -560    379484        0.1411101525028556

    -880    382576        0.14225990477578102

   Sub-folder structure : (same organization as in approach #1)
